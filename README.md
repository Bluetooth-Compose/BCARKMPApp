### MVP Progress

We are using [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) notation to mark our progress, and the best way of seeing the progress is to look at the commit lists.

However, we've copied the commit messages themselves here for a quick peek:

(in reverse order, latest at the top)

- chore(framework): converted from xml activity ui to jetpack compose, using default compose activity project as a guide
- chore(app): created default kotlin multiplatform app using android studio
